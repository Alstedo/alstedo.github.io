                  (click on your match in the bracket) to organize their game. This includes the
                  messaging of the server name and password to the competing team. The team on the “top”
                  of the bracket will create the private match for a series.

                <li>
                  Teams may register up to 5 players on their roster (3 starters + 2 subs). If a sub is not registered on a team
                  when check in closes, that person may not participate in the tournament.

                  If at any time during the tournament, a teammate is unable to participate or is not present,
                  teams will have 5 minutes to locate one of their 2 registered substitutes. Otherwise,
                  the team missing player(s) will forfeit the series.

                  If a team forfeits due to not having enough players or does not reply within 5 minutes,

                  If at any time you feel any team / player is breaking one of these rules,

                  A player is given 5 minutes to reconnect. If they do not reconnect, a substitute
                  will be allowed to play in their place. If the team does not have a registered substitute,

                  It is <b>STRONGLY</b> recommended that you save the replay for each game played
                  in a round. If any conflicts arise and only one team can provide a replay for
                  that match, the results will be based on that one replay alone. If no one can
                  provide a replay, a rematch will ensue being over watched by a moderator.

                Your <a href="https://battlefy.com/{{ site.battlefy_username }}">Battlefy</a> Rocket League team is separate from the team that is registered for the tourney.
                When you register for the tourney, it copies your current <a href="https://battlefy.com/{{ site.battlefy_username }}">Battlefy</a> team to the Participants list.
                If you add members to your team after you have registered, they won't be listed in the Participants list.
              </p>
              <p>
                The easiest solution is to leave the tourney and register again (only do this if the tourney is not full).
                You can also post a message in #help on <a href="https://discord.me/{{ site.discord_username }}">Discord</a> and a moderator will handle it.
