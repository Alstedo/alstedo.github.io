                  “Trash talking” is to be kept within reasonable limits.

                  If at any time you feel any team / player is breaking one of these rules,

                  You may have a max of 2 subs over the course of the tournament.
                  If your sub is not registered on your team at the time of the beginning
                  of the tournament, that person may not participate on the tournament.

                  If a team member disconnects due to technical difficulties such as
                  internet or power outage within the 1st minute of the 1st game in the series,
                  the Series will be restarted and the player will be allowed to reconnect.
                  If the player disconnects in the middle of the series (ex. Game 2 in a Bo5 Series),
                  they will be given 5 minutes to reconnect. If they do not reconnect during that
                  time a substitute will be allowed to play in their place. If your team does not
                  have a listed substitute, you will be forced to forfeit the series.

                  It is <b>STRONGLY</b> recommended that you save the replay for each game played
                  in a round. If any conflicts arise and only one team can provide a replay for
                  that match, the results will be based on that one replay alone. If no one can
                  provide a replay, a rematch will ensue being over watched by a moderator.

                Your <a href="https://battlefy.com/{{ site.battlefy_username }}">Battlefy</a> Rocket League team is separate from the team that is registered for the tourney.
                When you register for the tourney, it copies your current <a href="https://battlefy.com/{{ site.battlefy_username }}">Battlefy</a> team to the Participants list.
                If you add members to your team after you have registered, they won't be listed in the Participants list.

                The easiest solution is to leave the tourney and register again (only do this if the tourney is not full).
