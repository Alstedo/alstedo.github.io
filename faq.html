      <div class="questions">

        <h3>How do I check-in?</h3>
        <p>
          Check-in begins an hour before the tourney start time. At that time, go to the tournament page and click the red "Check-in" button. You can make sure you are checked in by clicking the "Participants" tab. If you need further help, post a message in #help on Discord.
        </p>

        <h3>How do I contact my opponents?</h3>
        <p>
          From the tournament page, click the "Brackets" tab. Then, find your match in the bracket and click on it. On this page, you should see a public and private chat. It's best to use the private chat to communicate lobby info to your opponents.
        </p>

        <h3>Where do I report scores?</h3>
        <p>
          From the tournament page, click the "Brackets" tab. Then, find your match in the bracket and click on it. From there, you should be able to report and save your score.
        </p>

        <h3>Is it possible to play with a player not listed on the roster?</h3>
        <p>
          No. If you want to add a sub after you have registered, post a message in the #help channel on Discord. Be aware that if this puts you over the 5 player limit, you will be asked to drop a player.
        </p>

        <h3>I added teammates to my team after I registered for the tourney, why aren't they listed as members of the team on the tourney "Participants" tab?</h3>
        <p>
          Your Battlefy Rocket League team is separate from the team that is registered for the tourney. When you register for the tourney, it copies your current Battlefy team to the Participants list. If you add members to your team after you have registered, they won't be listed in the Participants list. The easiest solution is to leave the tourney and register again (only do this if the tourney is not full). You can also post a message in #help on Discord and a moderator will handle it.
