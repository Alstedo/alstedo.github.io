# Rules

### Pre Game

1. Your team captain __MUST__ join Discord and be connected to our server until your team is eliminated or completes the tournament.  Your team will be disqualified immediately if your team captain is not on the Discord.
2. Team Captains __MUST__ join Discord with the name indicated on Battlefy. If we are unable to find you, your team will be disqualified from the tournament after 5 minutes.
3. Your team captain __MUST__ be in the Discord for our _briefing period_ (15 minutes before the tournament’s scheduled start time). Otherwise, your team will be disqualified immediately.
4. _Check-in_ (on Battlefy) ends 10 minutes before the tournament's scheduled start time.
5. Team Captains __MUST__ use the Battlefy Private Chat (click on your match in the bracket) to organize their game. This includes the messaging of the server name, password, and team colors to the competing team.
6. Teams must start a series with 3 players online and ready to join the server. If a team is missing a member, then they have 5 minutes to either: show up to the match or forfeit.
7. If at any time during the tournament, a teammate is unable to participate or is not present, teams will have ten minutes to locate one of your registered substitutes. Otherwise, the team missing a player(s) will forfeit the series.
8. After the 5 minutes of waiting for a team to respond, or if a team forfeits due to not having enough players. A screenshot will be required by the moderators with names of both teams captains and a timestamp showing when the picture was taken to confirm the forfeit or disqualification of the team.
9. Logos are welcome.
  - Battlefy allows a _100x100px_ logo to be uploaded on your team's page.
  - Please have a _100x100px_ render of your logo for our streaming purposes. You can upload this to the #team-logos text channel in the Discord.


### During Game

1. The default map for play is __DFH Stadium__ unless otherwise agreed upon by both team captains.
2. The default server for this tournament is __US East__. The server can be changed if agreed upon by both team captains.
3. The team on the "top" of the bracket will create the lobby (private match) for the series.
4. If the team being contacted does not reply within 5 minutes from the start of the round, they are immediately disqualified.
5. Teams are allowed to make substitutes __ONLY__ between series. If any substitute is made during a series, that team will be disqualified.
6. “Trash talking” is to be kept within reasonable limits. Any comments made that are considered offensive in anyway are to be reported to a moderator and will be handled appropriately.
7. Any exploitation or hacking results in suspension or banning from  Shift Pro League tournaments at the moderators discretion.
8. There will be no spectators allowed to watch over the matches except in the case the game is being streamed or a moderator is asked to watch over for point confirmation.
9. If at any time you feel any team / player is breaking one of these rules, or you feel they are being unfair, contact a moderator and explain the situation. It will be dealt with.
10. You may have a max of 2 subs over the course of the tournament. If your sub is not registered on your team at the time of the beginning of the tournament, that person may not participate on the tournament.
11. If a team member disconnects due to technical difficulties such as internet or power outage within the 1st minute of the 1st game in the series, the Series will be restarted and the player will be allowed to reconnect. If the player disconnects in the middle of the series (ex. Game 2 in a Bo5 Series) They will be given 5 minutes to reconnect. If they do not reconnect during that time a substitute will be allowed to play in their place. If your team does not have a listed substitute, you will be forced to forfeit the series.
12. Split-screen is __NOT ALLOWED__.


### Post Game

1. It is __STRONGLY__ recommended that you save the replay for each game played in a round. If any conflicts arise and only one team can provide a replay for that match, the results will be based on that one replay alone. If no one can provide a replay, a rematch will ensue being over watched by a moderator.

### Everything

Have fun! We do these tournaments because we love the community and hope we can become a large part in it! <3

Note: Admins/Mods have final say on judgement calls (rules are always subject to change).
